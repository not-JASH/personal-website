	<h1>Elder Scrolls V Skyrim True Nord Edition</h1>
	<h2>A rework and expansion of Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, with a focus on relationships.</h2>

	<h2> Skyrim is a beautiful, cold, and dangerous place where people must come together if they are to survive. </h3>
	<p style="font-size:20px"> 
		To focus gameplay on relationships, the difficulty of all enemies was increased such that venturing into Skyrim’s 
		wilderness alone almost certainly spells death for all but the highest-level adventurers; and a system was added 
		by which players can develop relationships with friendly NPCs, who might then choose to join the player in their 
		adventure.

	<h2>A living, breathing world where the player’s actions have an impact. </h3>
	<p style="font-size:20px"> 
		Each NPC is made unique via random stat and model assignments, and can be leveled up and equipped with weapons, 
		spells, and armor. Added new quests, many of which are focused on developing personal, and sometimes romantic, 
		relationships with the locals. NPCs fulfilling new societal roles and an interactive economy which responds to 
		the player’s actions were added.

	<h2>Skyrim is truly beautiful, cold, dark, and dangerous.</h3>
	<p style="font-size:20px"> 
		To bring Skyrim up to today’s standards, it was populated with thousands of new objects – like trees, shrubs, 
		underbrush, weapons, clothes, villages, cities, dungeons - and its lighting was completely reworked to make 
		the world truly look and feel alive.
